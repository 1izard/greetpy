# greetpy
This tool greets polite.
When it is day, says "Hello!", otherwise says "Good night..."

<hr>

This is for practice of Pipenv, setuptools, and tox.  
Python versions to be created and tested by `tox` are 3.6 and 3.7 according to `tox.ini`.  
Required version of python is defined with `python_requires = >=3.7` in `setup.cfg`.  
So can see that executing `$ tox` results in failure.
